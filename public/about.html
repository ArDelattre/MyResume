    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I am a computer science student, passionate about anything IT related. I find it really hard to chose one area
      to study in more depth, since everything seems so interesting to me. I love the practical aspect of web development, 
      but I always had a soft spot for Cybersecurity and AI. I'd like to think I will get to a point one day where I can start 
      designing my own intelligent agents.
    </p>

    <p>I studied in Australia, but did most of my primary and secondary education around the world. My family gave me the 
      opportunity from a young age to travel the world and familiarise myself with different cultures and individuals from
      many ethnic backgrounds, which was truly a blessing. I have a tendency to find an interest in what I do not fully comprehend,
      which keeps me curious and humble. Consequently I do not specialise in anything yet, but I am a quick and passionate learner
      with an optimistic attitude.
